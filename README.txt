a custom Field repository that transforms Wordpress custom fields into an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

== Description ==
Technically, Loki provides an easy-to-use interface for generating, populating and reading custom fields based on custom PHP objects.
Once you have created an object with some special property annotations, the plugin will do the rest.

1. Generation of custom fields, based on multiple providers
1. Mapping custom fields to custom objects
1. populating / reading custom fields by using setter/getter methods of your custom objects
